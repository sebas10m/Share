Power Apps and Power Automate solutions are deployed across three tenants (DEV, UAT and PROD), with Power BI used only on an exemption basis. Connections to external systems are controlled via on premises data gateways and CyberArk managed credentials and shared custom applications must pass UDA governance reviews before being published. Use cases focus on internal productivity, license usage tracking and automation of manual tasks rather than customer facing applications; sensitive data is protected through BYOK/CMK based encryption and role based access controls

Evidence of unmanaged Power BI usage and shadow IT proliferation persists, with unsanctioned deployments emerging despite official guidance that Power BI is unavailable . Access to applications remains restricted to authorised users, but the platform team will need to improve oversight to address support requests from business units and ensure UDA compliance
