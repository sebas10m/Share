Identity remains the primary attack surface. Over 80 % of breaches involve identity and the absence of MFA can enable a single account takeover to compromise your entire tenant

Visibility gaps create blind spots. Without continuous asset discovery and comprehensive logging, attackers can enumerate and pivot through M365 services without leaving traces

Network isolation and service governance are inconsistent. Power Platform often runs over public endpoints and unmanaged AI or Power BI usage leads to data sprawl and exposure

Missed detection and manual controls. Not deploying all available Microsoft 365 Defender and Sentinel capabilities forces reliance on manual controls and wastes licences, allowing threats to go unnoticed.

Blind spots in business applications. Sentinel doesn’t ingest telemetry from Dynamics, Power Automate or Copilot activities, so unauthorized access, data exfiltration or prompt‑injection attacks can occur silently

Expanded attack surface for Power Platform. Lack of virtual network integration and firewall rules means Dataverse traffic traverses public endpoints, undermining zero‑trust principles

Unmanaged Power BI usage. Departments create unapproved reports and datasets, resulting in shadow BI, data sprawl and untracked access

Accounts without MFA. Leaving user and privileged accounts unenrolled in MFA gives attackers an easy path to credential compromise

Unremediated compromised accounts. Without Entra ID user‑risk policies, compromised credentials can remain active until manually discovered

Adopt an integrated security architecture. Centralize Microsoft 365 Defender, Sentinel and Purview to close detection gaps and eliminate shadow‑IT

Strengthen identity controls. Enforce MFA and user‑risk policies for every account to drastically reduce the risk of account takeover

Secure the Power Platform and govern data tools. Enable vNet integration and firewall rules for Dataverse and implement centralized Power BI governance to prevent shadow BI

Improve logging and monitoring. Expand Sentinel connectors for Dynamics, Power Automate and Copilot, capture Graph API reconnaissance events, and regularly review Secure Score and license utilization

Standardize architecture and governance. Define and enforce a unified reference architecture across all services to streamline operations and close remaining gaps.

Implement AI service governance. Establish policies for Copilot and other AI features covering data access, prompt engineering and auditing to manage emerging risks.

Execute remediation plans now. Roll out MFA, network isolation and Power BI governance immediately, assign ownership and track progress through Secure Score metrics.
