Hi all, I’ve scheduled a “Power Platform Architecture – Kick-off Sync” for 9:00 as a 25-minute slot, but we can try to keep it to 15 minutes, as it’s been really hard to find a time when everyone is available this week. Praya, I’d be really happy if you can join before your OOO from 15 December – please let me know if this time is a blocker for anyone.
